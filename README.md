Work-Hub
========

Projet IA04 - NF28 - UTC

WorkHub is a software built to enhance collaborative work on different devices. The idea is to enable users to act as when brainstorming with paper and pen.

Users are able to share the same workspace and use post-it to brainstorm. They can create, edit and share these post-it. A post-it can be a text, a link or an image. We made a computer and Android tablet/smartphone version of the app. It is not totally finished and looks more like a proof of concept.

There is still work to do on this project since we could add other types of post-it, and adapt the application to other devices (iOS, ...). Last time we used it, there seemed to be a problem with the java version installed on the computer.
